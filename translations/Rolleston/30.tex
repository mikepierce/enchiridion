Our duties are  universally fixed by the relations in  which we find ourselves.
Is such  a man your father?  Then your duty is  to bear dictation from  him, to
take care of him, to yield to him in all things, to be patient with him when he
chides you, when he beats you. \emph{But if  he be a bad father?} Is there then
a natural  law that  you should be  related by  kin to a  good father?  No, but
simply to  a father. And does  your brother do  you wrong? Then guard  your own
proper position towards him,  and do not consider what he  is doing, but rather
what you may do  in order that your will may be in  accordance with Nature. For
no other can ever harm you if you do not choose it yourself, but you are harmed
then, when  you imagine  yourself to  be so.  Thus then  you may  discover your
duties by considering those of a neighbor, of a citizen, of a general,---if you
will accustom yourself to observe the relationships.
