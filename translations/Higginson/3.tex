With regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or
are tenderly beloved,  remind yourself of what nature they  are, beginning with
the merest trifles: if  you have a favorite cup, that it is  but a cup of which
you are fond  of---for thus, if it is  broken, you can bear it;  if you embrace
your child  or your wife,  that you embrace a  mortal---and thus, if  either of
them dies, you can bear it.
