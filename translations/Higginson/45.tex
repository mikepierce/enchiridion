Does anyone bathe  hastily? Do not say  that he does it ill,  but hastily. Does
anyone drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great
deal. For unless  you perfectly understand his motives, how  should you know if
he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances but such as you
fully comprehend.
