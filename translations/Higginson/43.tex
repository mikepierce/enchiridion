Everything has two handles:  one by which it may be borne,  another by which it
cannot. If  your brother acts unjustly,  do not lay  hold on the affair  by the
handle of  his injustice, for  by that  it cannot be  borne, but rather  by the
opposite---that he is your  brother, that he was brought up  with you; and thus
you will lay hold on it as it is to be borne.
