Duties are universally measured by relations.  Is a certain man your father? In
this are implied taking care of him, submitting to him in all things, patiently
receiving  his reproaches,  his correction.  But he  is a  bad father.  Is your
natural tie, then, to  a \emph{good} father? No, but to a  father. Is a brother
unjust? Well,  preserve your own  just relation  toward him. Consider  not what
\emph{he} does, but what \emph{you} are to do  to keep your own will in a state
conformable to nature, for another cannot  hurt you unless you please. You will
then be  hurt when you consent  to be hurt.  In this manner, therefore,  if you
accustom yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander,
you can deduce from each the corresponding duties.
