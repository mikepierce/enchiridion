Never say  of anything, ``I  have lost it,'' but,  ``I have restored  it.'' Has
your child died? It is restored. Has  your wife died? She is restored. Has your
estate been taken away?  That likewise is restored. ``But it was  a bad man who
took it.''  What is it  to you by  whose hands he who  gave it has  demanded it
again? While he permits  you to possess it, hold it as  something not your own,
as do travelers at an inn.
