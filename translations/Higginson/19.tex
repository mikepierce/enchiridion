You can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your
own power  to conquer.  When, therefore,  you see anyone  eminent in  honors or
power, or in high  esteem on any other account, take heed  not to be bewildered
by appearances and to pronounce him happy;  for if the essence of good consists
in things within  our own power, there  will be no room for  envy or emulation.
But, for your part,  do not desire to be a general, or  a senator, or a consul,
but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not
within our own power.
