These reasonings have no logical connection: ``I am richer than you,
therefore I am your superior.'' ``I am more eloquent than you, therefore I
am your superior.'' The true logical connection is rather this: ``I am
richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.'' ``I am more
eloquent than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.'' But you, after
all, consist neither in property nor in style.
