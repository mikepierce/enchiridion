Remember  that  you are  an  actor  in  a drama  of  such  sort as  the  Author
chooses---if short, then in a short one; if  long, then in a long one. If it be
his pleasure that you  should enact a poor man, or a cripple,  or a ruler, or a
private citizen, see that  you act it well. For this  is your business---to act
well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.
