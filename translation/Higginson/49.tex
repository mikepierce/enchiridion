When anyone shows himself vain on being able to understand and interpret
the works of Chrysippus,\footnotemark say to yourself: ``Unless Chrysippus had
written obscurely, this person would have had nothing to be vain of. But
what do I desire? To understand nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who
interprets her; and hearing that Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him.
I do not understand his writings. I seek, therefore, one to interpret
them.'' So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And when I find an
interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone
is the valuable thing. But if I admire merely the interpretation, what do
I become more than a grammarian, instead of a philosopher, except,
indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus? When anyone,
therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I
cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant with his
discourse.
\footnotetext{Chrysippus (c. 280--207 B.C.) was a Stoic philosopher who became
head of the Stoa after Cleanthes. His works, which are lost, were most
influential and were generally accepted as the authoritative
interpretation of orthodox Stoic philosophy.---Ed.}
