If you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very
first to have the multitude laugh and sneer,  and say, ``He is returned to us a
philosopher all  at once'';  and, ``Whence this  supercilious look?''  Now, for
your part, do not  have a supercilious look indeed, but  keep steadily to those
things which  appear best to  you, as one appointed  by God to  this particular
station. For  remember that, if you  are persistent, those very  persons who at
first ridiculed will  afterwards admire you. But if you  are conquered by them,
you will incur a double ridicule.
