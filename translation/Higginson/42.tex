When any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or
speaks from  an impression that  it is right  for him to do  so. Now it  is not
possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but only what appears
so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false appearances, he is the person
hurt,  since he,  too, is  the  person deceived.  For  if anyone  takes a  true
proposition to  be false,  the proposition  is not  hurt, but  only the  man is
deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a
person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, ``It seemed so to
him.''
