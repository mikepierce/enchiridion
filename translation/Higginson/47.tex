When you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique yourself upon
it; nor, if you drink water, be  saying upon every occasion, ``I drink water.''
But first consider how much more frugal are the poor than we, and how much more
patient of  hardship. If at  any time you would  inure yourself by  exercise to
labor and privation, for  your own sake and not for the  public, do not attempt
great feats;  but when you  are violently thirsty,  just rinse your  mouth with
water, and tell nobody.
