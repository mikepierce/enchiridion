If you  would improve, lay  aside such reasonings as  these: ``If I  neglect my
affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will
be good for nothing.''  For it were better to die of  hunger, exempt from grief
and fear, than  to live in affluence  with perturbation; and it  is better that
your servant should be bad than you unhappy.

Begin therefore with  little things. Is a  little oil spilled or  a little wine
stolen? Say to  yourself, ``This is the price paid  for peace and tranquillity;
and  nothing is  to be  had  for nothing.''  And  when you  call your  servant,
consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that
he may not do what  you wish. But it is not at all  desirable for him, and very
undesirable  for  you,  that it  should  be  in  his  power to  cause  you  any
disturbance.
