Be not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be
elated, and say, ``\emph{I am handsome,}'' it might be endurable. But when you are
elated and say, ``\emph{I have a handsome horse,}'' know that you are elated only
on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the
phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in
this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated
at some good of your own.
